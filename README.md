Various little code samples of my work

This repo contains code samples of my work from various professional and personal projects.

# W.I.P UE4 Project

This is a personal project I have been working on since the new year to learn new and strengthen existing skills with the Unreal Engine 4 and C++. 
Currently called 'Double Cross' the project is a 2D multiplayer social deception game where the players are performing a heist, but a informed minority
plan on double crossing the rest of the team. Players must simultaniously work together to gather loot while figuring out who are the traitors in the group.
